This plugin allows you to subscribe users to Aweber when they register or make a comment on your blog.

== Description ==

Aweber Wordpress is a plugin that will subscribe a user whenever he/she registers to your blog AND/OR posts a comment on your blog.  This powerful plugin will help you build your subscriber list.

The dashboard option page allows you to configure the plugin to display a checkbox with agreement text should you wish to ask for your visitors to first agree to be opt-in. You may also turn this feature off so that everyone who registers and/or makes a comment on your blog gets automatically subscribed to your list.

You will not find this plugin anywhere on the internet right now because it was never made available until now. We have used this plugin to explode our Aweber lists - think about all those commenters on your blog, they are forever lost if you don't get them on your list!

1. Upload the entire wpaweber folder to your wp-content/plugins/ directory.
