Flowline Customer Reviews allows your customers and visitors to leave reviews or testimonials of your services. Reviews are Microformat enabled (hReview).

== Description ==

There are many sites that are crawling for user-generated reviews now, including Google Places and Google Local Search. Flowline Customer Reviews allows you to setup a specific page on your blog to receive customer testimonials for your business/service OR to write reviews about multiple products (using multiple pages).

* WP Multisite and Multiuser (WPMU / WPMS / Wordpress MU) compatible.
* All submissions are moderated, which means that YOU choose which reviews get shown.
* Reviews are displayed to visitors in a friendly format, but search engines see the hReview microformat (and RDFa soon!)
* Multiple anti-spam measures to prevent automated spambots from submitting reviews.
* Provides a configurable `Business hCard`, to help identify all pages of your site as belonging to your business.
* Completely customizable, including which fields to ask for, require, and show.
* Works with caching plugins and all themes.
* Includes an external stylesheet so you can modify it to better fit your theme.
* Reviews can be edited by admin for content and date.
* Support for adding your own custom fields with one click.
* The plugin can be used on more than one page.
* Supports both `Business` and `Product` hReview types.
* Shows aggregate reviews microformat (`hReview-aggregate`).
* Fast and lightweight, even including the star rating image. This plugin will not slow down your blog.
* Validates as valid XHTML 1.1 (W3C) and valid Microformats (Rich Snippets Testing Tool).
* And much more...
